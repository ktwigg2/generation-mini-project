# <span style="color:#80bfff"> Mini Project

## Project overview

The aim for this project was to create an app to manage orders for a pop-up cafe in a busy area. Requirements based on the client brief were for the app to:

1. Maintain a collection of products and couriers
2. Create orders on the system
3. Update the delivery status of the orders
4. Persist and save data in a retrievable format
5. Be tested and proven to work 

---

## How the requirements were met:

- The app is able to maintain, update, and delete a collection of products, couriers, and orders, and the data is able to be persisted and saved in a retrievable format

## Requirements that were not met:

- Unit testing was meant to be used to guarantee the client's requirements, but unfortunately I've not been able to implement it yet 
- While the data is able to be persisted an dsave din a retrievable format, it is unfortunately not in the form of a database but rather CSV files

## Future work

If I had more time I would spend it on implementing unit testing and also setting up an SQL database. I would also implement a method to interpret and handle invalid user input.

## What I enjoyed

Mostly I enjoyed implementing pandas to read/write the CSV files, using the built-in CSV reader/writer was more wordy and confusing to learn, and so I found pandas to be more satisfying and more straightforward to use. I should have more practice with the native CSV module though.
